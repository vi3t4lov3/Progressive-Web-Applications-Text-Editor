## Description
This is a simple Progressive Web App (PWA) named text editor. This app uses both IndexedDB and Localstorage for persistent data.
The application will first search for data stored in indexedDb, but if there is no result then it will move in localStorage to populate the editor when it is loaded. As a PWA, this app is also capable to operate offline and save data locally on the user's devices.
This app is a handy tool if users just need to quickly write down a code idea or snippet, or users don't have acces to another text editor.
